# Week 1 Starter: System Info Monitor

Welcome to the first assignment in *Data Center Technologies 2025 Fall*.

## Instructions

1. Accept the assignment link from GitHub Classroom.
2. Open the repository in Codespaces (when available), or clone locally.
3. In `main.py`, use the `psutil` library to print:
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk usage
4. Make at least one `git commit` and `git push` after making your changes.
5. Submit the assignment (just push is enough; Iâ€™ll check the repo).

## Setup

- The `requirements.txt` file includes `psutil` as the only dependency.
- Use the default Python environment in Codespaces or local.
- You can run the script with:

```bash
python main.py
